# Ethereum Full Stack Development

A full-stack application for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. 

There are two main components of the app:

## Smart Contracts

1. A contract for creating and updating a message on the Ethereum blockchain
1. A contract for minting tokens, which allows the owner of the contract to send tokens to others and to read the token balances, and lets owners of the new tokens also send them to others

## User-Facing Application

1.Read the greeting from the contract deployed to the blockchain
1.Update the greeting
1.Send the newly minted tokens from their address to another address
1. Once someone has received tokens, allow them to also send their tokens to someone else
1. Read the token balance from the contract deployed to the blockchain
